Tethys Platform 1.1.0
*********************

**Last Updated:** May 20, 2015

We are pleased to announce that Tethys Platform 1.1.0 has finally arrived! Some of the new features include support for GeoServer, an OpenLayers Gizmo, and cloud computing through via HTCondor and TethysCluster. Stay tuned, because we have many more exciting things under development including Tethys app development for Windows and HydroShare dataset service support.

Tethys is a platform that can be used to develop and host water resources web applications or web apps. It includes a suite of free and open source software (FOSS) that has been carefully selected to address the unique development needs of water resources web apps. Tethys web apps are developed using a Python software development kit (SDK) which includes programmatic links to each software component. Tethys Platform is powered by the Django Python web framework giving it a solid web foundation with excellent security and performance.
