Tethys Platform
***************

**Last Updated:** December 9, 2014

Tethys is a platform that can be used to develop and host water resources web applications or web apps. It includes a suite of free and open source software (FOSS) that has been carefully selected to address the unique development needs of water resources web apps. Tethys web apps are developed using a Python software development kit (SDK) which includes programmatic links to each software component. Tethys Platform is powered by the Django Python web framework giving it a solid web foundation with excellent security and performance.

.. caution::

    Tethys Platform is currently under heavy development and as such is subject to change. However we plan to release version 1.0.0 in early 2015 so check back often. The current version of Tethys Platform is stable enough that you can experiment with building your first Tethys app. Follow the :doc:`./installation` instructions and then head over to the :doc:`./getting_started` tutorial to learn how.
