Tethys Platform is a growing Open Source project and we are always looking for developers who wish to contribute and help improve the platform. If you would like to contribute, join the discussion on the `Tethys GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys/discussions>`_ and visit the `Tethys Development Wiki <https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys/wiki>`_ on the Tethys Platform GitHub repository.

Development Installation
------------------------

For development we recommend installing Tethys Platform using the script, rather than the conda package. The script will clone the Git repository, making it possible for you to track changes and submit pull requests. It also allows you to install multiple Tethys installations.
