Refer to this article for information about each new release of Tethys Platform.

Release 1.4.0
=============

App Permissions
---------------

* There is now a formalized mechanism for creating permissions for apps.
* It includes a `permission_required` decorator for controllers and a `has_permission` method for checking permissions within controllers.

See: :doc:`tethys_sdk/permissions`

Tags for Apps
-------------

* Apps can be assigned tags via the "tags" property in app.py.
* App tags can be overriden by portal admins using the ``Installed Apps`` settings in the admin portal.
* If there are more than 5 app tiles in the apps library, a list of buttons, one for each tag, will be displayed at the top of the Apps Library page.
* Clicking on one of the tag buttons, will filter the list of displayed apps to only those with the selected tag.

Terms and Conditions Management
-------------------------------

* Portal Admins can now manage and enforce portal-wide terms and conditions and other legal documents.
* Documents are added via the admin interface of the portal.
* Documents can be versioned and dates at which they become active can be set.
* Once the date passes, all users will be prompted to accept the terms of the new documents.

See: :ref:`tethys_portal_terms_and_conditions`

GeoServer
---------

* The GeoServer docker was updated to version 2.8.3
* It can be configured to run in clustered mode (multiple instances of GeoServer running inside the container) for greater stability and performance
* Several extensions are now included:

   * `JMS Clustering <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.8.x/en/user/community/jms-cluster/index.html>`_
   * `Flow Control <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.8.x/en/user/extensions/css/index.html>`_
   * `CSS Styles <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.8.x/en/user/extensions/controlflow/index.html>`_
   * `NetCDF <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.8.x/en/user/extensions/netcdf/netcdf.html>`_
   * `NetCDF Output <http://docs.geoserver.org/2.8.x/en/user/extensions/netcdf-out/index.html>`_

See: :doc:`software_suite/geoserver`

Tethys Docker CLI
-----------------

* Modified behaviour of "-c" option to accept a list of containers names so that commands can be performed on subsets of the containers
* Improved behaviour of "start" and "stop" commands such that they will start/stop all installed containers if some are not installed
* Improved behaviour of the "remove" command to skip containers that are not installed

See: :ref:`tethys_cli_docker`

Select2 Gizmo
-------------

* Updated the Select2 Gizmo libraries to version 4.0.
* Not changes should be necessary for basic usage of the Select2 Gizmo.
* If you are using advanced features of Select2, you will likely need to migrate some of your code.
* Refer to `<https://select2.github.io/announcements-4.0.html#migrating-from-select2-35>`_ for migration help.

See: :doc:`tethys_sdk/gizmos/select_input`

MapView Gizmo
-------------

* New JavaScript API endpoints for the MapView.
* Use the `TETHYS_MAP_VIEW.getSelectInteraction()` method to have more control over items that are selected.
* MVLayer Select Features now supports selection of vector layers in addition to the WMS Layers.
* Added support for images in the legend including support for GeoServer GetLegendGraphic requests.

See: :doc:`tethys_sdk/gizmos/map_view`

PlotView Gizmo
--------------

* New JavaScript API endpoints for initializing PlotViews dynamically.

See: :doc:`tethys_sdk/gizmos/plot_view`

Workflow Job Type
-----------------

* New Condor Workflow provides a way to run a group of jobs (which can have hierarchical relationships) as a single job.
* The hierarchical relationships are defined as parent-child relationships between jobs.
* As part of this addition the original Condor Job type was refactored and, while backwards compatibility is maintained in version 1.4, several aspects of how job templates are defined have been deprecated.

See: :doc:`tethys_sdk/jobs/condor_workflow_type`

Testing Framework
-----------------

* New Tethys CLI command to run tests on Tethys and apps.
* Tethys SDK now provides a TethysTestCase to streamlines app testing.
* Persistent stores is supported in testing.
* Tethys App Scaffold now includes testing module with example test code.

See: :doc:`tethys_sdk/testing` and :ref:`tethys_cli_testing`

Installation
------------

* Installation Instructions for Ubuntu 16.04

See: :doc:`installation/ubuntu16`

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed an issue with URL mapping that was masking true errors with contollers (see: `Issue #177 <https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys/issues/177>`_)
* Fixed an issue with syncstores that use the string version of the path to the intializer function (see: `Issue #185 <https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys/issues/185>`_)
* Fixed an issue with syncstores that would cause it to fail the first time (see: `Issue #194 <https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys/issues/194>`_)
