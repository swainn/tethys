Software Development Kit
========================

Tethys Apps are developed in Python using a Model View Controller (MVC) strategy. The Tethys Apps plugin includes
the Tethys Software Development Kit (SDK) that provides many tools to aid in the rapid development of the apps. The
SDK also provides Python modules for working with all of the software that is included in the Tethys Software
Framework.

Scaffolding
-----------

A new app project can be started with a single command. The Tethys SDK provides a scaffold that will setup a simple
app project shell for you to build on.

Snippets
--------

The SDK takes advantage of the CKAN templating construct called "snippets." Snippets allow developers to insert common
user interface elements with a single line of code in the template. Examples of snippets that are included are range sliders,
toggle switches, buttons, interactive maps, and dynamic plots. All of the snippets are configured through Python.
