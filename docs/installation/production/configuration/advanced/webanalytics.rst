Tethys portals are configured to allow portal administrators to track how users interact with their portal and applications using web based analytical services. 24 services, including common services like Google Analytical and Optimizely, can be configured using the `Django-Analytical <https://github.com/jazzband/django-analytical>`_ package.

Key Concepts
============
Web Analytics generally work by adding an asynchronous script to the head of html pages that sends information about what the user does to another website where that data is processed and made available to the website administrator. The tracked website's information is associated with an ID number or character string that needs to be included in the tracking code. Django-Analytical is a python package that automates including the asynchronous scripts for 24 services.

Enabling Services
=================
After installing tethys in either a development or production environment, the tracking ID numbers or character strings can be specified in the Tethys portal's :file:`portal_config.yml` file found at ``$TETHYS_HOME/portal_config.yml``. In the ``settings`` section of the file you can add an ``ANALYTICS_CONFIG`` tag and then add any of the following ID's for many of the services supported by Django-Anlytical that are applicable.

.. code-block:: yaml

    ANALYTICS_CONFIG:
      CLICKMAP_TRACKER_ID: False
      CLICKY_SITE_ID: False
      CRAZY_EGG_ACCOUNT_NUMBER: False
      GAUGES_SITE_ID: False
      GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_JS_PROPERTY_ID: False
      GOSQUARED_SITE_TOKEN: False
      HOTJAR_SITE_ID: False
      HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID: False
      INTERCOM_APP_ID: False
      KISSINSIGHTS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER: False
      KISSINSIGHTS_SITE_CODE: False
      KISS_METRICS_API_KEY: False
      MIXPANEL_API_TOKEN: False
      OLARK_SITE_ID: False
      OPTIMIZELY_ACCOUNT_NUMBER: False
      PERFORMABLE_API_KEY: False
      PIWIK_DOMAIN_PATH: False
      PIWIK_SITE_ID: False
      RATING_MAILRU_COUNTER_ID: False
      SNAPENGAGE_WIDGET_ID: False
      SPRING_METRICS_TRACKING_ID: False
      USERVOICE_WIDGET_KEY: False
      WOOPRA_DOMAIN: False
      YANDEX_METRICA_COUNTER_ID: False

To start using one of these services to track your Tethys portal's usage, replace ``False`` with a string containing the tracking ID for that service. Be sure to follow the exact format for the ID provided by the service provider.

For example, Google Analytics generally requires a tracking ID in the format

.. code-block:: yaml

    UA-123456789-1

You must include the dashes and capitalize the UA at the beginning. If you wanted to implement a Google Analytics tracking for your portal, you would replace

.. code-block:: yaml

    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_JS_PROPERTY_ID = False

With the correctly formatted user ID as a string such as

.. code-block:: yaml

    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_JS_PROPERTY_ID = 'UA-123456789-1'

You can also use the ``tethys settings`` command to set these properties:

.. code-block:: bash

    tethys settings --set ANALYTICS_CONFIG.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_JS_PROPERTY_ID 'UA-123456789-1'

.. important::

    Remember to restart the Tethys servers to effect any changes to the :file:`portal_config.yml`:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo supervisor restart all
