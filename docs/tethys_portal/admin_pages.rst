Administrator Pages
*******************

**Last Updated:** October 2021

Tethys Portal includes administration pages that can be used to manage the website (see Figure 1). The administration dashboard is only available to administrator users (staff users). You should have created a default administrator user when you installed Tethys Platform. If you are logged in as an administrator, you will be able to access the administrator dashboard by selecting the "Site Admin" option from the user drop down menu in the top right-hand corner of the page (when you are not in an app).

.. note::

    If you did not create an administrator user during installation, run the following command in the terminal:

    ::

        tethys manage createsuperuser

Auth Token
==========

Tethys REST API tokens for individual users can be managed using the ``Tokens`` link under the ``AUTH TOKEN`` heading (see Figure 2).

Authentication and Authorization
================================

Permissions and users can be managed from the administrator dashboard using ``Users`` link under the ``AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION`` heading. Figure 3 shows an example of the user management page for a user named John.

.. _tethys_portal_app_permission_groups:

Assign App Permission Groups
----------------------------

To assign an app permission group to a user, select the desired user and locate the ``Groups`` dialog under the ``Permissions`` heading of the ``Change User`` page. All app permission groups will appear in the ``Available Groups`` list box. Assigning the permission group is done by moving the permission group to the ``Chosen Groups`` list box. Although the permissions may also appear in the ``User Permissions`` list box below, they cannot be properly assigned in the ``Change User`` dialog.

Assign App Access Permissions
-----------------------------

Administrators of Tethys Portal can control access to each app in the portal. However, this feature is disabled by default. To enable app access control set the following setting in the ``portal_config.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    settings:
      TETHYS_PORTAL_CONFIG:
        ENABLE_RESTRICTED_APP_ACCESS: True

.. caution::

    The effect of the ``ENABLE_RESTRICTED_APP_ACCESS`` setting is negated if ``ENABLE_OPEN_PORTAL`` is also set to `True`.

There are two ways to assign app permissions to users and groups. The first method is to use the ``Change Group`` page from the ``Group`` section of the administrator dashboard. The second method is using the ``object permission`` button from the ``Change Tethys App`` page of each individual installed app. The first method is recommended over the second one when working with app permissions at the group level because it offers a more responsive interface and it facilitates working with multiple permissions from different apps and groups at the same time. Both methods are described below.

Change Group Method (Recommended)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To assign app permissions to a user using the ``Change Group`` method, go to the administrator dashboard and select the ``Groups`` link under the ``Authentication and Authorization`` heading. Select the link with the group name from the list. On the ``Change Group`` page you can assign a group permissions to access a specific app from the ``Apps`` multiselect field by moving an app from the available app box to the chosen app box. Once an app is added to the chosen apps box, the form will dynamically display all the permissions and groups associated with that app if there are any. Individual permissions can be added to the group by moving the permissions from the available box of the specific app to the chosen box. In addition, all the permissions from another group that are associated to the specific app can also be added by moving the specific group from the available groups box to the chosen groups box. The ``Change Group`` form then needs to be saved for changes to take effect.

.. note::

    Since assigning the individual app permissions one by one can be a cumbersome process, we highly recommend that you use the ``Change Group`` page when working with multiple app permissions.

Object Permissions Method
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

To assign a singular app permission to a user using the ``Change Tethys App`` page, go to the administrator dashboard and scroll down to the ``Installed Apps`` link under the ``Tethys Apps`` heading. Select the link with the app name from the list. In the upper right corner of the ``Change Tethys App`` page click the ``Object Permissions`` button (see Figure 4). On the ``Object Permissions`` page you can assign app specific permissions to a user by entering the username in the ``User Identification`` field and press the ``Manage user`` button (see Figure 5). The same method can be used to add app permissions to a group using the ``Group`` section of the ``Object Permissions`` page.

Previously added App permissions can also be edited using this page.

Anonymous User
--------------

The ``AnonymousUser`` can be used to assign permissions and permission groups to users who are not logged in. This means that you can define permissions for each feature of your app, but then assign them all to the ``AnonymousUser`` if you want the app to be publicly accessible.

Python Social Auth
==================

Tethys leverages the excellent `Python Social Auth <https://python-social-auth-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/django.html>`_ to provide support for authenticating with popular servies such as Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, and HydroShare. The links under the ``PYTHON SOCIAL AUTH`` heading can be used to manually manage the social associations and data that is linked to users when they authenticate using Python Social Auth.

.. tip::

    For more detailed information on using Python Social Auth in Tethys see the :doc:`../installation/production/manual/configuration/advanced/social_auth` documentation.


.. _tethys_portal_terms_and_conditions:

Terms and Conditions
====================

Portal administrators can manage and enforce portal wide terms and conditions and other legal documents via the administrator pages.

Use the ``Terms and Conditions`` link to create new legal documents (see Figure 9). To issue an update to a particular document, create a new entry with the same slug (e.g. 'site-terms'), but a different version number (e.g.: 1.10). This allows you to track multiple versions of the legal document and which users have accepted each. The document will not become active until the ``Date active`` field has been set and the date has past.

.. figure:: ../images/tethys_portal/tethys_portal_toc_new.png
    :width: 675px

**Figure 9.** Creating a new legal document using the terms and conditions feature.

When a new document becomes active, users will be presented with a modal prompting them to review and accept the new terms and conditions (see Figure 10). The modal can be dismissed, but will reappear each time a page is refreshed until the user accepts the new versions of the legal documents. The ``User Terms and Conditions`` link shows a record of which users have accepted the terms and conditions.

.. _tethys_portal_app_settings:

Tethys Apps
===========

The links under the ``TETHYS APPS`` heading can be used to manage settings for installed apps and extensions. Clicking on the ``Installed Apps`` or ``Installed Extensions`` links will show a list of installed apps or extensions. Clicking on a link for an installed app or extension will bring you to the settings page for that app or extension. There are several different types of app settings: Common Settings, Custom Settings, and Service Settings.

An app can be disabled by unchecking the ``Enabled`` checkbox in the app settings page. A 404 error will be displayed in place of the disabled app if a user tries to open the app. Disabled apps appear as transparent apps in the ``Apps Library`` to admin users and users with permissions to access the app. Other users will not see the app in the ``Apps Library``.

An app can also be hidden from the ``Apps Library`` by unchecking the ``Show in apps library`` checkbox. Hidden apps can still be accessed directly through their ``URL`` endpoints by Admin users and users with app access permissions. In addition, Admin users can still see the app in the ``Apps Library``, but the app icon appears transparent and with the ``hidden`` tag added to the app title. Users without permission to access the app cannot see the app in the ``Apps Library`` or access it directly through its ``URL`` endpoint.

Common Settings
---------------

The Common Settings include those settings that are common to all apps or extension such as the ``Name``, ``Description``, ``Tags``, ``Enabled``, ``Show in apps library``, and ``Enable feedback`` (see Figure 11). Many of these settings correspond with attributes of the term:`app class` and can be overridden by the portal administrator. Other control the visibility or accessibility of the app.

    :width: 675px

**Figure 11.** App settings page showing Common Settings.

Custom Settings
---------------

Custom Settings appear under the ``CUSTOM SETTINGS`` heading and are defined by the app developer (see Figure 12). Custom Settings have simple values such as strings, integers, floats, or booleans, but all are entered as text. For boolean type Custom Settings, type a valid boolean value such as ``True`` or ``False``.

    :width: 675px

**Figure 12.** Custom Settings section of an app.

.. _tethys_portal_service_settings:

Service Settings
----------------

There are several different types of Service Settings including: ``Persistent Store Connection Settings``, ``Persistent Store Database Settings``, ``Dataset Service Settings``, ``Spatial Dataset Service Settings``, and ``Web Processing Service Settings`` (see Figure 13). These settings specify the types of services that the apps require. Use the drop down next to each Service Setting to assign a pre-registered ``Tethys Service`` to that app or use the *plus* button to create a new one.

.. _admin_pages_tethys_quotas:

Tethys Quotas
=============

The link under the ``TETHYS QUOTAS`` heading can be used to manage resource quotas that have been loaded into the Tethys Portal. Custom quotas can be created (see :ref:`tethys_quotas_custom_quota`), but by default Tethys includes two quotas: :ref:`tethys_quotas_user_admin` and :ref:`tethys_quotas_app_admin`.

.. _tethys_quotas_resource_quota:

Resource Quotas
---------------

``Resource Quotas`` shows a list of all loaded quotas. By default, all quotas are disabled when they are first loaded. Use this page to enable and customize the quotas for your portal (see Figure 10).

All quotas have the following fields that can be customized:

* ``Default`` - Default quota value.
* ``Help`` - Help text to be displayed to users when a quota is exceeded.
* ``Active`` - Enable to enforce this quota.
* ``Impose default`` -  When enabled the default quota will be used for users/apps that do not have a specific quota set. When disabled the quota will not be enforced on users/apps that do not have a specific quota set.

.. _tethys_quotas_user_admin:

User Workspace Quotas
---------------------

To manage quotas specific to individual users, navigate to the user's settings page. Any applicable Resource Quotas will be listed in the User Quotas section. To set a custom quota for the user, enter the custom value in the Value field on the line corresponding to the appropriate Resource Quota. A link to the ``Resource Quota`` is also provided in the table (see Figure 11).

.. _tethys_quotas_app_manage_storage:

Manage App Storage
------------------

Within the app settings page there is a ``Manage app storage`` section that provides a summary of the app workspace storage and the current quota being enforced on it (see Figure 6). To clear the workspace click the ``Clear Workspace`` button.

.. warning::
    ``Clear Workspace`` will completely empty the app workspace.

.. tip::

    See :ref:`tethys_quotas_workspace_manage` for information on how to pre/post process the app workspace when it is cleared.

.. _tethys_portal_tethys_services:

Tethys Services
===============

The links under the ``TETHYS SERVICES`` heading can be used to register external services with Tethys Platform for use by apps and extensions. Use the ``Spatial Dataset Services`` link to register your Tethys Portal to GeoServer, the ``Dataset Services`` link to register to CKAN or HydroShare instances, the ``Web Processing Services`` link to register to WPS instances, or the ``Persistent Store Services`` link to register a database.

.. tip::
