User Settings
=============

The User Settings page can be accessed through the drop-down menu located at the top right of the tethys portal window. Through the settings page a user can manage the information stored in their user profile.

.. tip::

    A non-editable view of the user's information can be accessed by clicking the user avatar icon to the left of the drop-down menu (see Figure 1).

Manage User Storage
===================

Within a user's settings page there is a ``Workspace`` section that provides a summary of the user's workspace storage across all apps and the current quota being enforced on it (see Figure 2). To manage the workspaces click the ``Manage Storage`` button, which will bring you to a table displaying workspace information for each app (see Figure 3). Use the Clear Workspace button next to each app to clear the workspace for that app.

    See :ref:`tethys_quotas_workspace_manage` for information on how to pre/post process the user workspace when it is cleared.
