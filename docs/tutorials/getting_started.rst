Getting Started

**Last Updated:** November 14, 2014

The getting started tutorial will walk you through the steps of setting up a new Tethys App project using Tethys Platform. If you have not already installed Tethys Platform, follow the :doc:`../installation` documentation and then return.

You will need to use the command line/terminal to manage your app and run the development server. It is highly recommended that you read the :doc:`../../supplementary/terminal_quick_guide` article for some tips if you are new to command line.
