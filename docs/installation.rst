This section describes how to get Tethys Platform up and running as a fresh installation for app development. If you are upgrading an existing installation the refer to the :ref:`update_tethys` docs. If you are deploying a production instance of Tethys Portal refer to the :ref:`production_installation` docs. If you want to contribute to the Tethys Platform source code itself then refer to the :ref:`developer_installation` docs.

Prerequisites
-------------

Tethys Platform requires the `conda packaging system <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html>`_. If you do not already have an installation of ``Miniconda`` (or ``Anaconda``) then refer to their `documentation <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ for installation instructions.

Also, be sure that the system you are using meets the minimum :ref:`system_reqs`.


1. Install the ``tethysplatform`` Conda Package
-----------------------------------------------

To install the ``tethysplatform`` into a new conda environment then run the following commands::

    conda create -n tethys -c tethysplatform -c conda-forge tethysplatform
    conda activate tethys


.. tip::

    To install a development build of of ``tethysplatform`` prepend the ``tethys/label/dev`` channel to the list of conda channels::

        conda create -n tethys -c tethys/label/dev -c tethysplatform -c conda-forge tethysplatform


    Alternatively, to install from source refer to the :ref:`developer_installation` docs.

2. Create a :file:`settings.py` File
------------------------------------

Tethys requires a :file:`settings.py` file to configure the database and other local settings. To generate a new :file:`settings.py` with default values for your local installation run::

    tethys gen settings

You can customize your :file:`settings.py` file when you generate it by passing in command line options. Refer to the :ref:`tethys_gen_cmd` docs to see what options are available.

.. tip::

    To see where the :file:`settings.py` file is saved on disk run the following command::

        tethys list -s

    If you want to edit the file manually and have a commandline editor, such as ``vi`` installed then you can run::

        vi $(tethys list -s)

3. Configure the Tethys Database
--------------------------------

Tethys Platform requires a PostgreSQL database server. There are several options for setting up a DB server: local, docker, or dedicated. For development environments you can use Tethys to create a local server::

    tethys db configure

.. note::

    The tethys db command (:ref:`tethys_db_cmd`) will create a local database server in the directory specified by the ``DIR`` setting in the ``DATABASES`` section of the :file:`settings.py` file. If the value of ``DIR`` is a relative path then the database server will be created relative to directory specified by the ``TETHYS_HOME`` environment variable. By default ``TETHYS_HOME`` is at `~/.tethys`.

    As an alternative to creating a local database server you can also configure a Docker DB server (see :ref:`using_docker`). A local database server is only recommended for development environments. For production environments please refer to :ref:`production_installation`.

4. Start the Development Server
-------------------------------

Once you have a database successfully configured you can run the Tethys development server::

    tethys manage start

This will start up a locally running web server. You can access the Tethys Portal by going to `<http://localhost:8000>`_ in your browser.

.. tip::

    You can customize the port that the server is running on by adding the ``-p`` option.

    ::

        tethys manage start -p 8001

    See :ref:`tethys_manage_cmd` for more details.
